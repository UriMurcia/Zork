*Coments on the project*
At the beginning of the project, I struggled to understand and remember some of the functionalities C++ has. As I used this programming language in the first and second year of my degree, it has been 2 years since I do not use it. 
After practicing with other projects and using different concepts like pointers and polymorphism, it was easy and funny to start and create this game.
I have tried to, not only to have a well organized code, but also to polish little details like damage of the weapons, good combat system, a nice interface (even if it is only text), and a good level design to make the player enjoy the game.
I really like the game I created, and even if it is a little short, I think is really funny. After testing the game with my brother and some friends, I have been able to see that a version of this game with a good user interface on it or a real game engine would be really enjoyable.
